# Usb Linux

## Introduction

When we connect an usb device, we wait to see it on the screen and then start working with it. This is how computers works, but not always, What happens if we are using a system that does not take the required actions to mount the USB device? For example, with a Tiling Windows Manager.

We will have to run the commands to mount the device and, when we want to disconnect the usb, more commands to unmount and extract the device are required. This if fine to learn how to work with an usb but doing all these steps every day is bad.

The objetive of this project is to automatice all the steps to connect and disconnect an usb in a Gnu/Linux system. First, we will see how to do it manually and then, how to automatice the process using some scripts that I developed.
